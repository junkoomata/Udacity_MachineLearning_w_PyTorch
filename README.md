# Udacity_MachineLearning_w_PyTorch
Final Project for nano degree course
Unsupervised Machine Learning final project, comparing general demographics of population clusters and mail order company's customer base clusters
Used: pca, RobustScaler, Kmeans clustering, inverse_transform to trace back what are the real means of clustered groups of people
I struggled weeks and weeks for the final part of trying to do comparison counterplot, because I was re-fitting so much in previous steps, just to desplay sklee plots
